        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This one is going to be easy. If you are new to making Nigerian foods and desires to start with the recipes that are easy, I would suggest you start here. This takes just about six different ingredients and the preparation time is less than 20 minutes.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs.</li>
            <li>2 spoons sliced pepper</li>
            <li> Vegetable oil (200ml).</li>
            <li>2 cups of sliced fresh tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Sliced pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>1 cup of sliced onions.</li>
            <li>One cube of maggi or knorr.</li>
            <li>Salt to taste.</li>
            <li>2 spoons of Sliced Green Peppers (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice your tomatoes, onions, and peppers.  You can easily do this with a sharp knife and chopping board.</li>
            <li>Set your frying pan on the heat and add just 200ml of oil (vegetable or olive oil), allow one minute before adding the sliced tomatoes/onions/peppers. It is best if you have a non-stick frying pan. Allow this to fry for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste. Add half a seasoning cube.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs in a separate plate. Add a pinch of salt to it and then pour on top of the frying tomato/onion/pepper combination. Allow a minute and then stir. Try to break the crumbs into smaller sizes.</li>
        </ol>
